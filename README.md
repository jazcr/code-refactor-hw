## Semantic HTML

I began this assignment by updating it to semantic HTML. I changed most of the div tags to section tags, while also updating the rest of them to header, main, aside and footer tags, accordingly. Semantic HTML is important because it allows easier accessability for both browsers and users - especially those with disabilities.

## Alt Attributes

I added Alt attributes to each image. I made sure that each image had a fair description so that they would be easily accesible for users who are visually impared. 

## Page Title

I updated the page title to  "Horiseon | SEO". This gives the page a more professional and expressive look.

## CSS

I was able to condense the CSS by roughly 100 lines of code (before adding comments). For example, I was able to assign the same class to each content section within the "Main" section of the HTML. By assigning a class of 'content-sec' to all sections, I was able to target all of them at once, rather that writing CSS for each individual section. I repeated the same process for all redundant CSS.

I also added comments to the CSS file between each major section. This was intended to help outside viewers be able to navigate through my code easier.
